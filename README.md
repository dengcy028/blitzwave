blitzwave C++ Wavelet Library
=============================

Please see the [project homepage](http://oschulz.github.com/blitzwave/) for
documentation. The documentation is also included in the blitzwave package
sources.

## Overview

blitzwave is a c++ wavelet mini-library building on the
[blitz++](http://blitz.sourceforge.net/) array template library.
blitzwave is heavily templated and supports wavelet decompositions of
n-dimensional arrays of various numerical data types.
You can define and use your own wavelets, a number of pre-defined,
ready-to-use wavelets are available.

Performance is quite good, similar to the
[WAILI](http://nalag.cs.kuleuven.be/research/software/wavelets/) library
(using datatype int for blitzwave).


## Status

blitzwave is stable and produces mathematically correct results. It
has been used in production for several different scientific projects
(that I know of). The API may still be subject to minor changes.
